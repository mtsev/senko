# Privacy Policy

This document entails the privacy policy and agreement that you accept when you use Senko#9625 ('the Bot') by adding keywords ('Bot User'), or as a member of a server that the Bot is also a member of ('Server Member').
  
This document does not supersede the [Developer Terms of Service](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/legal).


### Bot User Information Collected
The following information is collected and stored when you add keywords to the Bot:
* Your Discord ID
* Server ID of your and the Bot's mutual servers
* Keywords you add


### Server Member Information Usage
As a Server Member, your identifying information will **not** be stored by the Bot. However, your messages will be collected by the Bot and potentially relayed to a Bot User.  
  
By joining a server that the Bot is a member of, you agree that your message may be collected and reproduced by the Bot. 
  
Only messages sent in channels where both you and the Bot User are present will be relayed to the Bot User.


### Delete Collected Information
If you no longer wish to be a Bot User, you can remove all information stored about you by removing all your keyword using the relevant bot commands.
  
You cease to be a Bot User once all your keywords have been removed from the Bot, and all information about you will be deleted.
